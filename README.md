# Stopwatch
STOPWATCH: I developed and programmed a stopwatch using JS, CSS, and HTML. You can add minutes to the timer, reset it, pause it, and start it. It was built using JavaScript logic with manipulation of dates, numbers, and time.  To access it, just click the link below:  https://cronometro-woad.vercel.app/
